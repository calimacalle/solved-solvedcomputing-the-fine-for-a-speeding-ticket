Project 1Students will write an application to calculate speeding ticket fines for any number infractions. For each ticket, the input to this program will be the following (1) actual speed, (2) speed limit, (3) whether the offense occurred in a work zone, in a residential district, or not and (4) the court fees. The court fees are the same through the run, it is asked to the user only once. The output should show the total amount for the ticket. Once one total fine has been computed, the user should be given the choice of processing another ticket or quit.Speeding Fine: $5 per mile over speed limit plus Court Fees Speeding Highway Work Zone Fine: $6 per mile over speed limit plus Court Fees Speeding in a Residential District Fine: $7 per mile over speed limit plus $200 plus Court Fees Here is a typical session for this program: Enter court fees: 62 Enter the type of speeding offense (1 for regular, 2 for highway, 3 for residential): 1 Enter the speed limit: 25 Enter the vehicle speed: 35 The total fine is $112 Enter 1 to enter another ticket or 0 to quit this fine calculator: 1 Enter the type of speeding offense (1 for regular, 2 for highway, 3 for residential): 3 Enter the speed limit: 55 Enter the vehicle speed: 65 The total fine is $332 Enter 1 to enter another ticket or 0 to quit this fine calculator: 0 Good bye. The program needs to be structured using a class named FineCalculator that is in charge of computing the fine. The class declaration follows:class FineCalculator { public: FineCalculator(int courtFees); int getFine(int zone, int speedLimit, int actualSpeed) const; private: int _courtFees; };The getFine member function must not do any input or output, the only thing it does is computing the fine corresponding to the different parameters.
